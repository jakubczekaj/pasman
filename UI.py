# Version 0.1

# Usage:
# pasman.py <keyfile>
#   1. if file exists, prompt for a main password to decrypt it
#   2. if file does not exist, create one and prompt for a new main password to encrypt it
#   After that a new shell opens with below options:
#       a) list all/subset (e.g. by typing a 'site' value)
#       b) delete item (by list number?)
#       c) add new (provide a way to propose randomized password to the user)
#       d) edit
#       e) renumber the list (optional)
#       f) change main password for file encryption (optional)

# pasman.py # or --help, or -h
